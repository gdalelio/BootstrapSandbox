# BootstrapSandbox
This repository is being used for learning the Twitter Bootstrap framework.  The minified css and java script files aare included
in this repository.  As I work through examples I will add files named by the type of bootstrap example that file would represent.

##Layout Types
The following types of layouts determine how the pages respond to the changing width of the viewport of the device the
page is viewed on.  

__Fixed__: The grid is setup with the columns desired and then when the screen is viewed on smaller screens - they stay and the 
           the column text gets narrower and elongates the column (text stays the same font size).


##Examples Included
+ Fixed Layout      => Bootstrap-FixedLayout.html
+ Responsive Layout => Bootstrap-Responsive-Layout.html
